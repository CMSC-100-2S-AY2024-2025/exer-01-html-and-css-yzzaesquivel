-------- Steps on how to create a GitHub page
1. Create a new repository.
2. Use git commands to push your files in the repositoy.
3. In your GitHub repository, go to Settings. Then, click Pages from the options below.
4. Choose 'Deploy from a branch' >  Choose your branch > Choose /(root).
5. Click Save.
6. Wait for it to deploy. Then you can have your GitHub page link for your website.


-------- Key Takeaways
Always keep your code organized and clean for better readability and easier editing of your website (something I'm still working out on). I had fun making this exercise since it's been a long time since I worked with HTML and CSS.
